This program allows the user to create their own colors using three seekbars to determine the RGB values, which are then presented in hexidecimal form. The background will change colors depending on the RGB values.

The user can save a color by clicking the "Save Color" button. This will display their color in a listview, as well as each of the color's components.
The seekbars will then be reset to the color white.

By clicking or tapping on one of the saved colors, the seekbars and background will change to that selected color.
